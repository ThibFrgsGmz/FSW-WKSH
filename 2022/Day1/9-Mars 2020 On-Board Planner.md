Q: How does communications delay affect issuing a replanning task?

A: If the question is about communication with ground operations, there is no direct dependency between operator communication and onboard replanning.
The operators provide the set of activities to be considered at the start of the day, during the uplink communications window, and from then on the On-Board Planner is on its own, deciding when to replan based on results from the plan execution.
