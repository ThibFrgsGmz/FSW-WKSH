The John Hopkins created the workshop (specifically Christopher Krupiarz).

It is a division/lab of John Hopkins University and is affiliated with a research center.

Their lab has 7200 members and a revenue of $1.76 billion.

They are sponsored by
    DoD (United States) Department of Defense,
    NASA,
    DHS (United States) Department of Homeland Security,
    IC (United States) Intelligence Community.

Their operating cycle: 
- Research;
- Conceive;
- Design;
- Build;
- Test;
- Operate.

They make critical contributions to major challenges.

When the U.S. government is faced with a difficult problem, they call on APL to do the work and make sure everything works the way it should.

Scope:
- Strategic Systems Testing & Evaluation;
- Submarine Security & Survivability;
- Space Science and Engineering;
- Combat System & Guided Missiles;
- Theater Air Defense & Power Projection;
- Information Technology;
- Simulation, Modeling & Operations Analysis;
- Mission-Related Research & Development.

In all their missions since 1960, they have a software technology heritage.
Since the 1990's, they started to develop their FSWSystem, nicknamed "FSWCore", which they use on all their satellites. They then integrated the cFS into their FSWCore which greatly improved their standadization.

They have moved from a "last mission modification" policy to a "Reusable Core" policy where each project reuses, contributes to and maintains this framework.
Examples of recent projects include Parker Solar Probe, DART, IMAP, Dragonfly.

Their MESSENGER satellite was the first to use the CCSDS File Transfer Protocol but also the implementation of a PostFix evaluation engine (Reverse Polish Notation - RPN) which is an automation engine.
