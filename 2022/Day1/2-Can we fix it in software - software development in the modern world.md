| 11:40 AM  | 12:40 PM  | KEYNOTE - “Can we fix it in software?” - software development in the modern world  | Hans Koenigsman | Aerospace Advisor  |
	
Hans is retired from SpaceX, where he was the fourth engineer to join the company in 2002.
He worked on Falcon 1 and Falcon 9, flew as chief engineer, vice president of avionics, etc.

He is not a software, flight or ground engineer, but a mechanical and electronic engineer.
However, he has written flight and simulation software.

He learned C/C++ languages in college.

He has opinions on why startups succeed:

- Fast-paced startups benefit from multidisciplinary and diverse teams/people with flat hierarchies (Note: No organizational silos, a common workspace for all engineers?)

- Communication is a priority, eliminating communication noise in favor of clear, concise, acronym-free information. Minimal documentation, but documentation of interfaces between disciplines (Note: Engineers need to interact directly with end users to better understand expectations?)

- A simple work and approval process.

Complexity in flight software comes mainly from interfaces with sensors, redundancies.

The more integrated the software is with the hardware teams, the better.
