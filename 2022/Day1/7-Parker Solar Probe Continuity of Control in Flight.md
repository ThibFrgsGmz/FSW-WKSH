5 rotations of processors in orbit
- 3 controlled by the ground
- 2 controlled by the autonomy

Star Tracker aborts in flight due to environmental effects.
Star Tracker 2 exceeded its power utilization threshold during a high-speed downlink in February 2018.

Coolant => water.

Q: About processor rotation.
I didn't understand that the rotation occurs in response to an event. That makes perfect sense.
Regarding my question about processing, I was referring to the processing of scientific data. Doesn't this have to do with the speed of the flyby, since the data acquisition and processing has to be done faster?

A: The data acquisition is done at the same speed, but it is stored on board until it can be transmitted later and processed on the ground.
