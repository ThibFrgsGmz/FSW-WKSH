Q: Did you use any simulations to test your FSW? if so, what was the sim architecture used?

A: Since most of our system is human comanded w/ on/off output, we prioritized testing over sims, but we are working towards feeding recorded datasets back into controllers to simulate fill and launch scenarios in python.
