Q:
What makes this system linux? it looks so much different. What about bootloader? can it be used with uboot?

A: We use the Linux from kernel.org and the UserLand from either RedHawk, CentOS, Ubuntu or now Rocky Linux.
So the user interface is anything you are familiar with. We have not had any requests for uboot but we could make it work.
