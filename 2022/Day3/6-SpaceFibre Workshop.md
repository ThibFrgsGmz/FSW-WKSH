Q: Are the Virtual Channels meant to map to CCSDS AOS VCDUs?

A: Virtual channels are used to construct virtual networks which have quality of service properties, so are for different classes of information. CCSDS AOS VCDUs would be sent in packets over a single virtual network. Only if you needed to have some AOS VCDUs with higher priority than others, would you need to put them on a different virtual network/virtual channel.
