Q: Is "techno solidaryity" a mission attribute? So if a team has a mission, like military operations, this develops and is somewhat the same?

A: Technosolidarity is a quality that comes from the way the mission is organized and how it makes decisions.So we do see this, for instance, in mixed human robot teams like in the military with mine-defusing robots.
Their “teammates” in the platoon develop a powerful relationship with them that mirrors and extends the relationship they have with each other as members of the same troup.
When the robot is ‘injured’ in operations, they often ask for their robot to be repaired instead of getting a new one; if it’s damaged beyond repair, they give it a funeral and last rites.
So yes, it’s a mission attribute, but it’s more about the organization of the group, and not about the qualities of the “mission” or tasks per se.

Q: The interaction with advance autonomy (perceived behaviors) is similar to that experienced in advance aircraft avionics system. Did you see a parallel in the experiences? (Human vs SW and human vs vehicle)

A: There is a lot of intersection between avionics and space exploration.
I can’t do justice to that in a quick answer unfortunately. But again, I like th ematerial about “sense-making.”
The loss of Air France flight out of Brazil is a great example, where the confusion arose betwen too many automated systems and humans trying to make sense of the disaster.
It’s another reason why full automation can’t and should be the goal.

Q: How do we apply these concepts to the original flight software development teams at NASA for unmanned satellite missions that are not robots per se?

A: I work with many teams that are not robots, and I have colleagues who work with systems that range from algorithmic softwrae all the way to huge hardware like CERN.
I think these lessons apply whether your’e working with something in space or on earth, something complex and semi-autonomous or something more straightforward.
Even if it’s not “a robot” there are always times when we have to make sense of what our code is doing and make decisions about what to do next.
